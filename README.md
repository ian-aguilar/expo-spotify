## Expo Web

Currently Expo Web support is not production ready, but if you want to see how this project looks on the web as a PWA (Progressive Web App)...

[PWA: Expo Spotify](https://expo-spotify.calebnance.now.sh) looks best on a mobile device, but not bad on desktop!

View the code here: [feature_expo-web](https://github.com/calebnance/expo-spotify/tree/feature_expo-web)

a couple manual changes within `index.html` i found needed to be made so far:
- "mobile-web-app-capable" => "apple-mobile-web-app-capable"
- apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style="default" => "black-translucent"
- set background color within body{} example: background-color: #121212;
- double image meta tags
- double/triple js packages
